# Payment System & Smart Contract Integration

> **üöÄ NEW: INFT Agent System Available!** - Now supporting intelligent NFT agents alongside traditional credits

## Overview

Our payment system is built on the Sonic blockchain, utilizing smart contracts for transparent, automated distribution of generation payments to stakeholders. Now featuring both traditional credit purchases and revolutionary INFT (Intelligent NFT) agents that combine AI capabilities with ownership rights.

## Payment Models

### 1. Traditional Credits System
- Purchase credits with various tokens
- Pay per generation (1 credit = 1 generation)
- Instant processing, no ownership rights

### 2. INFT Agent System ‚≠ê NEW
- Mint intelligent AI agents as NFTs
- Agents include embedded credits and learning capabilities
- Own both the agent and all content it generates
- Transferable, tradeable, and rentable through AIaaS

Our payment system processes all transactions instantly with low fees and full transparency.

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Main Payment Contract

**SonicAIGenerationPayment Contract**
- **Network**: Sonic Mainnet
- **Purpose**: Handles all generation payments and distributions
- **Security**: Audited and battle-tested
- **Upgradability**: Proxy pattern for future improvements

**Key Functions:**
```solidity
// Pay with S tokens
function payWithS(string prompt, string generationType)

// Pay with USDC  
function payWithUSDC(string prompt, string generationType)

// Use credits for generation
function useCredits(string prompt, string generationType)

// Admin: Add credits to user account
function addCredits(address user, uint256 amount)
```

### Payment Distribution Logic

When a user pays for generation, funds are automatically distributed:

```
Total Payment (100%)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 25% ‚Üí BanditKidz Staking Contract
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 15% ‚Üí Weekly Contest Prize Pool  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 50% ‚Üí Developer Wallet
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 10% ‚Üí Contract Reserves
```

**Distribution Details:**

**25% to BanditKidz Staking (Immediate)**
- Funds sent directly to staking contract
- Accumulated for monthly distributions
- Pro-rata allocation to all staked NFT holders
- Supports long-term holder rewards

**15% to Contest Winners (Weekly)**
- Held in contract until contest ends
- Automatically distributed to top 3 winners
- Prize allocation: 50% / 30% / 20% split
- Payable in same tokens as original payments

**50% to Developer Wallet (Immediate)**
- Covers operational costs and development
- Server infrastructure and AI model access
- Platform maintenance and improvements  
- Team compensation and growth

**10% to Contract Reserves (Accumulating)**
- Emergency fund for platform stability
- Future feature development
- Community initiatives and partnerships
- Long-term sustainability fund

## Transaction Flow

### Standard Generation Payment

1. **User Initiates Payment**
   - Selects payment method and enters prompt
   - Wallet shows transaction preview with gas estimates
   - User confirms transaction in wallet

2. **Smart Contract Processing**
   - Validates user has sufficient balance
   - Transfers tokens from user to contract
   - Executes automatic distribution logic
   - Emits events for tracking

3. **Distribution Execution**
   - 25% sent to staking contract immediately
   - 15% held for weekly contest pool
   - 50% sent to developer wallet
   - 10% retained in contract reserves

4. **Generation Trigger**
   - Contract emits `GenerationRequested` event
   - Backend services pick up event
   - AI generation process begins
   - Results stored and linked to payment

5. **Community Submission**
   - Generation automatically submitted to thread
   - Voting contract records generation details
   - User earns leaderboard eligibility
   - Available for community voting

### Transaction Verification

**On-Chain Transparency**
- All transactions visible on Sonic Explorer
- Smart contract addresses are public
- Distribution percentages immutable in code
- Real-time balance tracking available

**Event Logging**
```solidity
event PaymentReceived(
    address indexed payer, 
    address indexed token, 
    uint256 amount, 
    string generationType
);

event GenerationRequested(
    address indexed user, 
    string prompt, 
    string generationType, 
    uint256 generationId
);
```

## FeeM Integration

### Automatic Rewards Registration

**FeeM Protocol Benefits**
- **Registration**: Contract automatically registers for FeeM rewards
- **Reward Direction**: All FeeM rewards sent to staking contract
- **Additional Yield**: Bonus rewards for ecosystem participation
- **Passive Income**: No user action required

**Implementation:**
```solidity
function registerMe() external onlyOwner {
    (bool success,) = address(0xDC2B0D2Dd2b7759D97D50db4eabDC36973110830).call("");
    require(success, "FeeM registration failed");
}
```

### Reward Amplification
- **Base Rewards**: Platform usage generates FeeM rewards
- **Staking Boost**: Rewards amplify staking distributions  
- **Community Benefits**: More rewards = higher staking yields
- **Growth Incentive**: Success breeds more success

## Gas Optimization

### Efficient Contract Design

**Batch Operations**

## Integration Guide for Developers

### Smart Contract Integration

**Contract Addresses**
```javascript
// Sonic Mainnet
const PAYMENT_CONTRACT = "0x..." // Main payment contract
const STAKING_CONTRACT = "0x..." // BanditKidz staking
const VOTING_CONTRACT = "0x..."  // Community voting
const NFT_CONTRACT = "0x6988c29f8c0051d261f288c2c497a592e2d1061f"
```

**Basic Integration Example**
```javascript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';

// Connect to Sonic network
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.soniclabs.com');
const contract = new ethers.Contract(PAYMENT_CONTRACT, ABI, provider);

// Pay with USDC
async function payWithUSDC(prompt, generationType) {
  const tx = await contract.payWithUSDC(prompt, generationType);
  return await tx.wait();
}

// Listen for generation events
contract.on('GenerationRequested', (user, prompt, type, id) => {
  console.log(`Generation ${id} requested by ${user}`);
});
```

### API Integration

**Backend Event Handling**
```javascript
// Listen for payment events
const handlePaymentEvent = async (event) => {
  const { payer, token, amount, generationType } = event.args;
  
  // Trigger AI generation
  await processGeneration({
    user: payer,
    prompt: event.prompt,
    type: generationType,
    paymentTx: event.transactionHash
  });
};
```

**Frontend Integration**
```javascript
// React component for payment
const PaymentButton = ({ prompt, type }) => {
  const { writeContract } = useWriteContract();
  
  const handlePayment = () => {
    writeContract({
      address: PAYMENT_CONTRACT,
      abi: PaymentABI,
      functionName: 'payWithUSDC',
      args: [prompt, type]
    });
  };
  
  return <button onClick={handlePayment}>Pay with USDC</button>;
};
```

## Economic Model

### Token Economics

**Value Flow**
```
User Payment ‚Üí Smart Contract ‚Üí Automatic Distribution
    ‚Üì               ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
Generation      Transparency      Stakeholder Rewards
```

**Deflationary Mechanics**
- **Burn Mechanism**: Potential future token burns from reserves
- **Staking Rewards**: Tokens locked in staking reduce circulating supply
- **Utility Demand**: Growing platform usage drives token demand
- **Network Effects**: More users = more value for all participants

### Revenue Sustainability

**Multiple Revenue Streams**
- **Generation Payments**: Primary revenue from AI content creation
- **Premium Features**: Advanced tools and priority processing
- **NFT Marketplace**: Trading fees on BanditKidz transactions
- **Partnership Revenue**: Integration fees from third parties

**Cost Management**
- **AI Model Costs**: Optimized through bulk contracts and efficiency
- **Infrastructure**: Scalable cloud architecture with usage-based pricing
- **Development**: Sustainable funding through revenue percentage
- **Community**: Self-sustaining through token incentives
