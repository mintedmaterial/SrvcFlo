- Create marketplace integration for agent trading
- Develop performance tracking and reward distribution systems

### Data Pipeline & Monitoring Foundation
- Establish agent workflow monitoring and analytics using /agent-ui/Agents/tmp SQLite databases for session tracking
- Create data collection pipelines for trading preparation leveraging /agent-ui/Agents/storage MongoDB for historical data
- Implement real-time agent performance tracking with database health monitoring across both storage systems
- Build notification systems for agent status and alerts with database connectivity checks
- Prepare infrastructure for advanced trading feature integration maintaining existing storage patterns
- Configure data retention policies for tmp (SQLite) and persistent (MongoDB) storage systems
