Roadmap Priority: The tokenomics introduce a dual-token system: $FLO for governance/staking/value capture (fixed 1 billion supply) and $SERV as a high-velocity, uncapped utility token for operational payments (AI tasks, computational resources). User tiers include Free (3–5 actions/day), Standard ($0.25/input), Pro ($0.50–$3.00/input), Premium ($0.75–$5.00/output), with monthly subscriptions ($20/Standard, $60/Pro, $120/Premium for full access). Staking/rewards apply to ServiceFlow iNFTs (earn $SERV based on performance/reputation) and Bandit Kidz NFTs (earn 20% of $SERV fees from image generation/platform revenue). Fee distribution splits $SERV fees: 5% to $FLO buyback/burn, 15% to leaderboard, 20% to Bandit Kidz stakers, 10% to iNFT stakers, 50% to treasury. Dynamic USD-to-token conversion via Chainlink oracle pegs $SERV at ~$1. Governance is via DAO with quadratic voting. These elements, along with a new priority of rebranding the agent-ui to align with a "matrixy vibe" (e.g., sleek, futuristic, cyberpunk aesthetic with green digital rain, dark backgrounds, neon accents) matching Srvcflo.com products/dapp site, take precedence for the agent launchpad/workflow builder to enable monetized AI workflows, task payments, staking incentives, and leaderboard rewards, before expanding image/video generation monetization (tied to iNFT/Bandit Kidz rewards, fee splits). The agent-ui rebranding involves updating the UI design to reflect this aesthetic, ensuring visual consistency with Srvcflo.com’s products/dapp. Host Agno agents and the rebranded Srvcflo-ui on Streamlit or Netlify, while products/landing page/dapp remain on Cloudflare workers and products. Deploy a stable version of the rebranded Srvcflo-ui off your machine for team members to access agent-ui or team/project agents (e.g., via a local server, containerized setup like Docker, or cloud-based staging environment accessible to the team). Start with Srvcflo Team/App agents for Sonic Eco content/promotion, project analyst (NFT/pool monitoring via authenticated users holding $SERV, slash commands for adding collections/contracts), auto-trading toggles/parameters (using OpenOcean/Fly.trade for trading; Silo/Metro/Equalizer/Beets/Shadow for DeFi liquidity/farming/lending). Researcher agents auto-add projects after 10+ user researches for tracking/trading if safe. Prioritize ecosystem tokenomics/base contracts/presale: $FLO allocation (30% team with 4-year vesting/12-month cliff, 7.5% presale with 2-year vesting/6-month cliff, 5% airdrops to Bandit Kidz/5 communities at 8.33M each); $SERV dynamic minting/burning for ~$1 peg; presale raises for liquidity (75% lock/20% provider/5% dev, adjusted for dynamic issuance). Focus on data pipelines/workflows/agent-approved actions: fix content agent, sync social content (Twitter/Facebook/Threads/Instagram) for app/NFT/ERC-20 ecosystem research/trading. Agent flows: research → approved tradable collections/projects → signals/indicators/strategies → auto-trade if toggled/conditions met. Less priority: Srvcflo.com products like iNFT agent packages (1st: image generation with $SERV fees/tiered pricing via GeneratedArtNFT.sol for minting/staking; 2nd: NFT monitoring/tracking; 3rd: ecosystem analyst; marketplace), incorporating Bandit Kidz staking and leaderboard (15% monthly $SERV rewards to top users via smart contract mappings/functions for userActivity/distributeLeaderboardRewards).
Target Users: The tokenomics target tiered users: Free (limited actions, earn $SERV for rating iNFTs), Standard/Pro/Premium (paid inputs/outputs via $SERV, monthly subscriptions for full access, cashback for >100 $SERV/month), $FLO stakers (10–20% off $SERV fees for staking 10,000+ $FLO, governance rights), ServiceFlow iNFT holders/stakers (earn $SERV based on agent performance/reputation, influence operations), Bandit Kidz NFT holders (stake to earn 20% of $SERV fees from image generation/platform revenue, proportional to staked NFTs), leaderboard participants (top users by activity earn 15% monthly $SERV rewards), and airdrop recipients (Bandit Kidz top holders plus 5 communities, 8.33M $FLO each). Focus is on individual users (crypto enthusiasts, NFT traders/investors, AI workflow users in Sonic ecosystem) and team/monthly subscribers (high-volume Pro/Premium for unlimited access). Verticals are web3/crypto: Sonic Labs Layer 1, NFT collections on PaintSwap, DeFi pools/liquidity on Silo/Equalizer, ecosystem analysts/traders using Dexscreener/DefiLlama/OpenOcean/Fly.trade. Users must hold/mint $SERV (via native S) for dashboard/agents access (Discord/Twitter/Telegram) or stake $FLO/iNFTs/Bandit Kidz for rewards/discounts. No traditional small service businesses (e.g., contractors/salons), but adaptable for crypto community content creators/social managers.
Team Workflow: Incorporate tokenomics-specific coding standards and rebranding requirements into Agent OS documentation. Use Solidity for smart contracts: GeneratedArtNFT.sol (iNFT minting/staking via mintGeneratedArt/stakeINFT, mappings for iNFTStakers/userActivity, functions for distributeINFTRewards/distributeLeaderboardRewards/updateActivity), BanditKidzStaking contract (separate for staking Bandit Kidz NFTs, mappings for stakedNFTs, stake/distributeRewards functions), and fee distribution logic (distributeFees splitting $SERV fees to $FLO buyback/burn, leaderboard, Bandit Kidz, iNFTs, treasury, using IERC20/IERC721 interfaces). Integrate Chainlink oracles for $SERV ~$1 USD peg and dynamic pricing (adjust fees for congestion/demand). For agent-ui rebranding, update front-end code (e.g., HTML/CSS/JS, potentially using Claude-generated HTML output) to adopt a matrixy vibe (cyberpunk aesthetic: green digital rain, dark backgrounds, neon accents) aligned with Srvcflo.com products/dapp site. Host Agno agents and rebranded Srvcflo-ui on Streamlit or Netlify, ensuring compatibility with the matrixy design. Deploy a stable Srvcflo-ui version off your machine (e.g., via Docker containers, a local server like Node.js/Express, or a cloud-based staging environment like AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, or Heroku with access restricted to team members via authentication, such as OAuth or IP whitelisting) for team access to agent-ui or team/project agents. Development practices use MCP servers with .agent-os/Claude/Serena/Agno framework for team/monthly users. Srvcflo Agno team agents access tmp/SQL/MongoDB, Cloudflare RAG/KV/D1/R2 for project docs/building; products/landing page/dapp remain on Cloudflare workers/products. Test customized agents in E2B sandboxes (Python/JS SDKs for AI-generated code in isolated VMs). Devs provide team access to internal agents or deploy own via Agno base. Capture ethical incentives (reputation scores from user ratings, $FLO slashing for unethical behavior via DAO). Data pipelines include Coincodex/Coindesk APIs (provided key for crypto prices/OHLCV/on-chain DEX), Dexscreener for pairs, PaintSwap open-source API for NFT marketplace/orderbook, Discord channels (NFT-screen for collection data; Tweet-screen for KOL/influencer analysis from @SiloIntern
/@IntelScout
). Add standards for AI-curated proposals (on-chain data analysis for governance) and anti-dumping (AI monitors $FLO dumps >1% supply/24h for auto-buys if funded).
Deployment Strategy: Backend/team agents (Srvcflo team Lead/Agno assist/NFT/ECO investor/content/promotion/analyst/trader) deploy on MCP servers/Cloudflare (workers/KV/D1/R2 for landing page/dapp/marketplace/iNFT dashboard, RAG for docs), handling social content sync (X/Discord/Telegram/Facebook/Instagram/Threads), Sonic Eco creation, trading/liquidity (PaintSwap/Dexscreener/DefiLlama/OpenOcean/Fly.trade/Silo/Equalizer), with team access/deploy via Agno base. The rebranded Srvcflo-ui (matrixy vibe) and Agno agents are hosted on Streamlit or Netlify, while Srvcflo.com products/landing page/dapp remain on Cloudflare workers/products. A stable Srvcflo-ui version is deployed off your machine (e.g., Dockerized setup or local server with Nginx/Node.js, accessible via VPN or secure endpoints like ngrok for team members) to provide access to agent-ui or team/project agents. User-deployed agents are decentralized ServiceFlow iNFTs (minted via GeneratedArtNFT.sol, ERC-721/7857 for tokenizing coordinators/content creators/image generators/NFT/eco analysts, user-customizable; staked for $SERV rewards based on performance/reputation/task fees, e.g., 10% of fees with bonuses for high ratings). Users route from Cloudflare app to on-chain agents (generative UI with matrixy vibe via HTML output), paying via $SERV tiers/subscriptions (dynamic USD conversion via Chainlink, e.g., $20/month = ~20 $SERV). Integrate Bandit Kidz staking (separate contract for 20% $SERV fees, proportional to staked NFTs). Monetization: Mint iNFT packages (starting at 50 S for coordinator-researcher-NFT/eco analyst-image/video-social), image generation to user-selected ERC-721 collections (hosted on Thread page for voting/leaderboard; shared royalties), NFT marketplace for mint/bid/list/purchase/offer using $SERV/$FLO, plus subscriptions/fees (split: 5% $FLO buyback/burn, 15% leaderboard, 20% Bandit Kidz, 10% iNFTs, 50% treasury). Contracts: iNFT factory/agents/packages (GeneratedArtNFT.sol with staking/rewards), ERC-20 $SERV (uncapped, dynamic mint/burn), $FLO (fixed 1B, governance/voting), BanditKidzStaking, user-minted collections (royalties), staking/payment splitter/marketplace, Serv voting token, potentially special for team trading. Presale: $FLO 7.5% with 2-year vesting/6-month cliff; $SERV funds locked liquidity (75% lock/20% provider/5% dev via dynamic issuance); optional vNFT unlocks. Users toggle auto-trading in UI (agents handle if parameters met). Ensure separation: team backend centralized on MCP/Cloudflare, rebranded Srvcflo-ui on Streamlit/Netlify (with stable team version off your machine), user agents on-chain/decentralized under Sonic for ethical/governance compliance (DAO for upgrades/treasury/AI proposals).
