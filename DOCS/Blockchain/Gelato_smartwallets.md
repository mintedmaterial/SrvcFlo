# Overview

Smart Wallets are an evolution of traditional crypto wallets that leverage Account Abstraction (e.g., EIP-4337, EIP-7702) to offer a more flexible, user-friendly, and secure experience. Unlike Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), which rely solely on private keys, Smart Wallets are upgrade to existing EOA wallets to smart accounts.

## Why Smart Wallets?

Traditional EOAs come with several limitations:

* Manual gas fee management by users
* Complex onboarding with seed phrases
* Poor user experience, especially for newcomers
* No support for gasless or token-based fee payments

## Key Benefits

Smart Wallets address these challenges by introducing:

* Allow users to pay fees with ERC-20 tokens or let dApps sponsor gas
* Enable login via email, phone, or social accounts (through embedded wallets)
* Add features like account recovery, session keys, spending limits, and more
* Provide a unified experience across multiple EVM-compatible chains

## Gelato's Smart Wallet SDK Key Features

To make smart wallets easy to adopt and integrate, Gelato introduced the Smart Wallet SDK, offering native support for both EIP-7702 and ERC-4337 â€” all in a single, modular React SDK.

### Developer Benefits

With this SDK, developers can:

* Instantly upgrade EOAs to smart accounts using EIP-7702
* Build fully ERC-4337-compatible smart accounts without managing their own bundler or paymaster infrastructure
* Integrate embedded wallets with familiar Web2-style logins (email, phone, social)
* Support gas abstraction with ERC-20 fee payments and gas sponsorship
* Maintain a cross-chain native experience across supported EVM networks.
