Connect Wallet
The ability for a user to connect their wallet is a core function for any Dapp. It allows users to perform tasks such as: writing to contracts, signing messages, or sending transactions.

Wagmi contains everything you need to get started with building a Connect Wallet module. To get started, you can either use a third-party library or build your own.

Third-party Libraries
You can use a pre-built Connect Wallet module from a third-party library such as:

ConnectKit - Guide
AppKit - Guide
RainbowKit - Guide
Dynamic - Guide
Privy - Guide
The above libraries are all built on top of Wagmi, handle all the edge cases around wallet connection, and provide a seamless Connect Wallet UX that you can use in your Dapp.

Build Your Own
Wagmi provides you with the Hooks to get started building your own Connect Wallet module.

It takes less than five minutes to get up and running with Browser Wallets, WalletConnect, and Coinbase Wallet.

1. Configure Wagmi
Before we get started with building the functionality of the Connect Wallet module, we will need to set up the Wagmi configuration.

Let's create a config.ts file and export a config object.


config.ts

import { http, createConfig } from 'wagmi'
import { base, mainnet, optimism } from 'wagmi/chains'
import { injected, metaMask, safe, walletConnect } from 'wagmi/connectors'

const projectId = '<WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID>'

export const config = createConfig({
  chains: [mainnet, base],
  connectors: [
    injected(),
    walletConnect({ projectId }),
    metaMask(),
    safe(),
  ],
  transports: {
    [mainnet.id]: http(),
    [base.id]: http(),
  },
})
In the above configuration, we want to set up connectors for Injected (browser), WalletConnect (browser + mobile), MetaMask, and Safe wallets. This configuration uses the Mainnet and Base chains, but you can use whatever you want.

WARNING

Make sure to replace the projectId with your own WalletConnect Project ID, if you wish to use WalletConnect!

2. Wrap App in Context Provider
Next, we will need to wrap our React App with Context so that our application is aware of Wagmi & React Query's reactive state and in-memory caching.


app.tsx

config.ts

 // 1. Import modules
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { WagmiProvider } from 'wagmi'
import { config } from './config'

// 2. Set up a React Query client.
const queryClient = new QueryClient()

function App() {
  // 3. Wrap app with Wagmi and React Query context.
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}> 
        {/** ... */} 
      </QueryClientProvider> 
    </WagmiProvider>
  )
}
3. Display Wallet Options
After that, we will create a WalletOptions component that will display our connectors. This will allow users to select a wallet and connect.

Below, we are rendering a list of connectors retrieved from useConnect. When the user clicks on a connector, the connect function will connect the users' wallet.


wallet-options.tsx

app.tsx

config.ts

import * as React from 'react'
import { Connector, useConnect } from 'wagmi'

export function WalletOptions() {
  const { connectors, connect } = useConnect()

  return connectors.map((connector) => (
    <button key={connector.uid} onClick={() => connect({ connector })}>
      {connector.name}
    </button>
  ))
}
4. Display Connected Account
Lastly, if an account is connected, we want to show some basic information, like the connected address and ENS name and avatar.

Below, we are using hooks like useAccount, useEnsAvatar and useEnsName to extract this information.

We are also utilizing useDisconnect to show a "Disconnect" button so a user can disconnect their wallet.


account.tsx

wallet-options.tsx

app.tsx

config.ts

import { useAccount, useDisconnect, useEnsAvatar, useEnsName } from 'wagmi'

export function Account() {
  const { address } = useAccount()
  const { disconnect } = useDisconnect()
  const { data: ensName } = useEnsName({ address })
  const { data: ensAvatar } = useEnsAvatar({ name: ensName! })

  return (
    <div>
      {ensAvatar && <img alt="ENS Avatar" src={ensAvatar} />}
      {address && <div>{ensName ? `${ensName} (${address})` : address}</div>}
      <button onClick={() => disconnect()}>Disconnect</button>
    </div>
  )
}
5. Wire it up!
Finally, we can wire up our Wallet Options and Account components to our application's entrypoint.


app.tsx

account.tsx

wallet-options.tsx

config.ts

import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { WagmiProvider, useAccount } from 'wagmi'
import { config } from './config'
import { Account } from './account'
import { WalletOptions } from './wallet-options'

const queryClient = new QueryClient()

function ConnectWallet() {
  const { isConnected } = useAccount()
  if (isConnected) return <Account />
  return <WalletOptions />
}

function App() {
  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={config}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}> 
        <ConnectWallet />
      </QueryClientProvider> 
    </WagmiProvider>
  )
}
