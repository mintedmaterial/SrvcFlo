  server_name app.openocean.net;

  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  proxy_set_header Host "widget.openocean.finance";
  proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header X-Real-PORT $remote_port;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  client_max_body_size 20m;
  location / {
    proxy_pass https://widget.openocean.finance;
  }
}
```

#### Step 2 - Config Front-end Ôºàfor example: openocean.netÔºâ
