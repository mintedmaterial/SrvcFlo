**Start from CLI** - scaffold a Next.js project on Workers.

* npm

  ```sh
  npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-next-app --framework=next
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn create cloudflare my-next-app --framework=next
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm create cloudflare@latest my-next-app --framework=next
  ```

This is a simple getting started guide. For detailed documentation on how the to use the Cloudflare OpenNext adapter, visit the [OpenNext website](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare).

## What is Next.js?

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a [React](https://react.dev/) framework for building full stack applications.

Next.js supports Server-side and Client-side rendering, as well as Partial Prerendering which lets you combine static and dynamic components in the same route.

You can deploy your Next.js app to Cloudflare Workers using the OpenNext adapter.

## Deploy a new Next.js project on Workers

1. **Create a new project with the create-cloudflare CLI (C3).**

   * npm

     ```sh
     npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-next-app --framework=next
     ```

   * yarn

     ```sh
     yarn create cloudflare my-next-app --framework=next
     ```

   * pnpm

     ```sh
     pnpm create cloudflare@latest my-next-app --framework=next
     ```

   What's happening behind the scenes?

   When you run this command, C3 creates a new project directory, initiates [Next.js's official setup tool](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), and configures the project for Cloudflare. It then offers the option to instantly deploy your application to Cloudflare.

2. **Develop locally.**

   After creating your project, run the following command in your project directory to start a local development server. The command uses the Next.js development server. It offers the best developer experience by quickly reloading your app every time the source code is updated.

   * npm

     ```sh
     npm run dev
     ```

   * yarn

     ```sh
     yarn run dev
     ```

   * pnpm

     ```sh
     pnpm run dev
     ```

3. **Test and preview your site with the Cloudflare adapter.**

   * npm

     ```sh
     npm run preview
     ```

   * yarn

     ```sh
     yarn run preview
     ```

   * pnpm

     ```sh
     pnpm run preview
     ```

   What's the difference between dev and preview?

   The command used in the previous step uses the Next.js development server, which runs in Node.js. However, your deployed application will run on Cloudflare Workers, which uses the `workerd` runtime. Therefore when running integration tests and previewing your application, you should use the preview command, which is more accurate to production, as it executes your application in the `workerd` runtime using `wrangler dev`.

4. **Deploy your project.**

   You can deploy your project to a [`*.workers.dev` subdomain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/) or a [custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/) from your local machine or any CI/CD system (including [Workers Builds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/#workers-builds)). Use the following command to build and deploy. If you're using a CI service, be sure to update your "deploy command" accordingly.

   * npm

     ```sh
     npm run deploy
     ```

   * yarn

     ```sh
     yarn run deploy
     ```

   * pnpm

     ```sh
     pnpm run deploy
     ```

## Deploy an existing Next.js project on Workers

You can convert an existing Next.js application to run on Cloudflare

1. **Install [`@opennextjs/cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opennextjs/cloudflare)**

   * npm

     ```sh
     npm i @opennextjs/cloudflare@latest
     ```

   * yarn

     ```sh
     yarn add @opennextjs/cloudflare@latest
     ```

   * pnpm

     ```sh
     pnpm add @opennextjs/cloudflare@latest
     ```

2. **Install [`wrangler CLI`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler) as a devDependency**

   * npm

     ```sh
     npm i -D wrangler@latest
     ```

   * yarn

     ```sh
     yarn add -D wrangler@latest
     ```

   * pnpm

     ```sh
     pnpm add -D wrangler@latest
     ```

3. **Add a Wrangler configuration file**

   In your project root, create a [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) with the following content:

   * wrangler.jsonc

     ```jsonc
     {
       "main": ".open-next/worker.js",
       "name": "my-app",
       "compatibility_date": "2025-03-25",
       "compatibility_flags": [
         "nodejs_compat"
       ],
       "assets": {
         "directory": ".open-next/assets",
         "binding": "ASSETS"
       }
     }
     ```

   * wrangler.toml

     ```toml
       main = ".open-next/worker.js"
       name = "my-app"
       compatibility_date = "2025-03-25"
       compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
       [assets]
       directory = ".open-next/assets"
       binding = "ASSETS"
     ```

   Note

   As shown above, you must enable the [`nodejs_compat` compatibility flag](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) *and* set your [compatibility date](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-dates/) to `2024-09-23` or later for your Next.js app to work with @opennextjs/cloudflare.

4. **Add a configuration file for OpenNext**

   In your project root, create an OpenNext configuration file named `open-next.config.ts` with the following content:

   ```ts
   import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";


   export default defineCloudflareConfig();
   ```

   Note

   `open-next.config.ts` is where you can configure the caching, see the [adapter documentation](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare/caching) for more information

5. **Update `package.json`**

   You can add the following scripts to your `package.json`:

   ```json
   "preview": "opennextjs-cloudflare build && opennextjs-cloudflare preview",
   "deploy": "opennextjs-cloudflare build && opennextjs-cloudflare deploy",
   "cf-typegen": "wrangler types --env-interface CloudflareEnv cloudflare-env.d.ts"
   ```

   Usage

   * `preview`: Builds your app and serves it locally, allowing you to quickly preview your app running locally in the Workers runtime, via a single command. - `deploy`: Builds your app, and then deploys it to Cloudflare - `cf-typegen`: Generates a `cloudflare-env.d.ts` file at the root of your project containing the types for the env.

6. **Develop locally.**

   After creating your project, run the following command in your project directory to start a local development server. The command uses the Next.js development server. It offers the best developer experience by quickly reloading your app after your source code is updated.

   * npm

     ```sh
     npm run dev
     ```

   * yarn

     ```sh
     yarn run dev
     ```

   * pnpm

     ```sh
     pnpm run dev
     ```

7. **Test your site with the Cloudflare adapter.**

   The command used in the previous step uses the Next.js development server to offer a great developer experience. However your application will run on Cloudflare Workers so you want to run your integration tests and verify that your application workers correctly in this environment.

   * npm

     ```sh
     npm run preview
     ```

   * yarn

     ```sh
     yarn run preview
     ```

   * pnpm

     ```sh
     pnpm run preview
     ```

8. **Deploy your project.**

   You can deploy your project to a [`*.workers.dev` subdomain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/) or a [custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/) from your local machine or any CI/CD system (including [Workers Builds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/#workers-builds)). Use the following command to build and deploy. If you're using a CI service, be sure to update your "deploy command" accordingly.

   * npm

     ```sh
     npm run deploy
     ```

   * yarn

     ```sh
     yarn run deploy
     ```

   * pnpm

     ```sh
     pnpm run deploy
     ```
