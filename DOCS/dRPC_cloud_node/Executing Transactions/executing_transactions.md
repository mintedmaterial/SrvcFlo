Executing transactions
Enables sending tokens, interacting with smart contracts, and performing on-chain operations.

eth_call: Executes a contract call without broadcasting a transaction.
eth_sendRawTransaction: Sends a signed transaction to the network.

These methods are essential for executing transactions and interacting with smart contracts on Sonic.
