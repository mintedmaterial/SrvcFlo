A testnet faucet gives web3 developers free tokens to deploy, test, and optimize smart contracts on test blockchains.
Since running smart contracts on public mainnet blockchains like Ethereum and Polygon requires gas fees, testnets offer a way for developers to work in an environment similar to the mainnet without incurring real-money costs for gas fees.
