Teams and roles
Teams
When you first log in and your user record is created, so does your initial team. At first, you are the only member of this team, and you are the team owner. You can send invitation for other members to their email addresses. If needed, new team can be created using modal form on your current team page. Currently we have a limitation of 5 teams per user.
