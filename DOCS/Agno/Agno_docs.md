# What is Agno?

> Agno is a python framework for building multi-agent systems with shared memory, knowledge and reasoning.

Engineers and researchers use Agno to build:

* **Level 1:** Agents with tools and instructions ([example](/introduction/agents#level-1%3A-agents-with-tools-and-instructions)).
* **Level 2:** Agents with knowledge and storage ([example](/introduction/agents#level-2%3A-agents-with-knowledge-and-storage)).
* **Level 3:** Agents with memory and reasoning ([example](/introduction/agents#level-3%3A-agents-with-memory-and-reasoning)).
* **Level 4:** Agent Teams that can reason and collaborate ([example](/introduction/multi-agent-systems#level-4%3A-agent-teams-that-can-reason-and-collaborate)).
* **Level 5:** Agentic Workflows with state and determinism ([example](/introduction/multi-agent-systems#level-5%3A-agentic-workflows-with-state-and-determinism)).

**Example:** Level 1 Reasoning Agent that uses the YFinance API to answer questions:

```python Reasoning Finance Agent
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),
    tools=[
        ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True),
        YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True, company_news=True),
    ],
    instructions="Use tables to display data.",
    markdown=True,
)
```

# What are Agents?

> **Agents are AI programs that operate autonomously.**

Traditional software follows a pre-programmed sequence of steps. Agents dynamically determine their course of action using a machine learning **model**, its core components are:

* **Model:** controls the flow of execution. It decides whether to reason, act or respond.
* **Tools:** enable an Agent to take actions and interact with external systems.
* **Instructions:** are how we program the Agent, teaching it how to use tools and respond.

Agents also have **memory**, **knowledge**, **storage** and the ability to **reason**:

* **Reasoning:** enables Agents to "think" before responding and "analyze" the results of their actions (i.e. tool calls), this improves reliability and quality of responses.
* **Knowledge:** is domain-specific information that the Agent can **search at runtime** to make better decisions and provide accurate responses (RAG). Knowledge is stored in a vector database and this **search at runtime** pattern is known as Agentic RAG/Agentic Search.
* **Storage:** is used by Agents to save session history and state in a database. Model APIs are stateless and storage enables us to continue conversations from where they left off. This makes Agents stateful, enabling multi-turn, long-term conversations.
* **Memory:** gives Agents the ability to store and recall information from previous interactions, allowing them to learn user preferences and personalize their responses.

<Check>Let's build a few Agents to see how they work.</Check>

## Level 1: Agents with tools and instructions

The simplest Agent has a model, a tool and instructions. Let's build an Agent that can fetch data using the `yfinance` library, along with instructions to display the results in a table.

```python level_1_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),
    tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=True)],
    instructions="Use tables to display data. Don't include any other text.",
    markdown=True,
)
agent.print_response("What is the stock price of Apple?", stream=True)
```

Create a virtual environment, install dependencies, export your API key and run the Agent.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup your virtual environment">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Mac
      uv venv --python 3.12
      source .venv/bin/activate
      ```

      ```bash Windows
      uv venv --python 3.12
      .venv/Scripts/activate
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Mac
      uv pip install -U agno anthropic yfinance
      ```

      ```bash Windows
      uv pip install -U agno anthropic yfinance
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export your Anthropic key">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Mac
      export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-***
      ```

      ```bash Windows
      setx ANTHROPIC_API_KEY sk-***
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the agent">
    ```shell
    python agent_with_tools.py
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Set `debug_mode=True` or `export AGNO_DEBUG=true` to see the system prompt and user messages.
</Note>

## Level 2: Agents with knowledge and storage

**Knowledge:** While models have a large amount of training data, we almost always need to give them domain-specific information to make better decisions and provide accurate responses (RAG). We store this information in a vector database and let the Agent **search** it at runtime.

**Storage:** Model APIs are stateless and `Storage` drivers save chat history and state to a database. When the Agent runs, it reads the chat history and state from the database and add it to the messages list, resuming the conversation and making the Agent stateful.

In this example, we'll use:

* `UrlKnowledge` to load Agno documentation to LanceDB, using OpenAI for embeddings.
* `SqliteStorage` to save the Agent's session history and state in a database.

```python level_2_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.embedder.openai import OpenAIEmbedder
from agno.knowledge.url import UrlKnowledge
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.storage.sqlite import SqliteStorage
from agno.vectordb.lancedb import LanceDb, SearchType

# Load Agno documentation in a knowledge base
# You can also use `https://docs.agno.com/llms-full.txt` for the full documentation
knowledge = UrlKnowledge(
    urls=["https://docs.agno.com/introduction.md"],
    vector_db=LanceDb(
        uri="tmp/lancedb",
        table_name="agno_docs",
        search_type=SearchType.hybrid,
        # Use OpenAI for embeddings
        embedder=OpenAIEmbedder(id="text-embedding-3-small", dimensions=1536),
    ),
)

# Store agent sessions in a SQLite database
storage = SqliteStorage(table_name="agent_sessions", db_file="tmp/agent.db")

agent = Agent(
    name="Agno Assist",
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),
    instructions=[
        "Search your knowledge before answering the question.",
        "Only include the output in your response. No other text.",
    ],
    knowledge=knowledge,
    storage=storage,
    add_datetime_to_instructions=True,
    # Add the chat history to the messages
    add_history_to_messages=True,
    # Number of history runs
    num_history_runs=3,
    markdown=True,
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load the knowledge base, comment out after first run
    # Set recreate to True to recreate the knowledge base if needed
    agent.knowledge.load(recreate=False)
    agent.print_response("What is Agno?", stream=True)
```

Install dependencies, export your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and run the Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install new dependencies">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Mac
      uv pip install -U lancedb tantivy openai sqlalchemy
      ```

      ```bash Windows
      uv pip install -U lancedb tantivy openai sqlalchemy
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the agent">
    ```shell
    python level_2_agent.py
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Level 3: Agents with memory and reasoning

* **Reasoning:** enables Agents to **"think" & "analyze"**, improving reliability and quality. `ReasoningTools` is one of the best approaches to improve an Agent's response quality.
* **Memory:** enables Agents to classify, store and recall user preferences, personalizing their responses. Memory helps the Agent build personas and learn from previous interactions.

```python level_3_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.memory.v2.db.sqlite import SqliteMemoryDb
from agno.memory.v2.memory import Memory
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

memory = Memory(
    # Use any model for creating and managing memories
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),
    # Store memories in a SQLite database
    db=SqliteMemoryDb(table_name="user_memories", db_file="tmp/agent.db"),
    # We disable deletion by default, enable it if needed
    delete_memories=True,
    clear_memories=True,
)

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),
    tools=[
        ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True),
        YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True, company_news=True),
    ],
    # User ID for storing memories, `default` if not provided
    user_id="ava",
    instructions=[
        "Use tables to display data.",
        "Include sources in your response.",
        "Only include the report in your response. No other text.",
    ],
    memory=memory,
    # Let the Agent manage its memories
    enable_agentic_memory=True,
    markdown=True,
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This will create a memory that "ava's" favorite stocks are NVIDIA and TSLA
    agent.print_response(
        "My favorite stocks are NVIDIA and TSLA",
        stream=True,
        show_full_reasoning=True,
        stream_intermediate_steps=True,
    )
    # This will use the memory to answer the question
    agent.print_response(
        "Can you compare my favorite stocks?",
        stream=True,
        show_full_reasoning=True,
        stream_intermediate_steps=True,
    )
```

Run the Agent

```shell
python level_3_agent.py
```

<Tip>You can use the `Memory` and `Reasoning` separately, you don't need to use them together.</Tip>


# Multi Agent Systems

> Teams of Agents working together towards a common goal.

## Level 4: Agent Teams that can reason and collaborate

Agents are the atomic unit of work, and work best when they have a narrow scope and a small number of tools. When the number of tools grows beyond what the model can handle or you need to handle multiple concepts, use a team of agents to spread the load.

Agno provides an industry leading multi-agent architecture that allows you to build Agent Teams that can reason, collaborate and coordinate. In this example, we'll build a team of 2 agents to analyze the semiconductor market performance, reasoning step by step.

```python level_4_team.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.team.team import Team
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

web_agent = Agent(
    name="Web Search Agent",
    role="Handle web search requests and general research",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4.1"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    instructions="Always include sources",
    add_datetime_to_instructions=True,
)

finance_agent = Agent(
    name="Finance Agent",
    role="Handle financial data requests and market analysis",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4.1"),
    tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, stock_fundamentals=True,analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True)],
    instructions=[
        "Use tables to display stock prices, fundamentals (P/E, Market Cap), and recommendations.",
        "Clearly state the company name and ticker symbol.",
        "Focus on delivering actionable financial insights.",
    ],
    add_datetime_to_instructions=True,
)

reasoning_finance_team = Team(
    name="Reasoning Finance Team",
    mode="coordinate",
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),
    members=[web_agent, finance_agent],
    tools=[ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True)],
    instructions=[
        "Collaborate to provide comprehensive financial and investment insights",
        "Consider both fundamental analysis and market sentiment",
        "Use tables and charts to display data clearly and professionally",
        "Present findings in a structured, easy-to-follow format",
        "Only output the final consolidated analysis, not individual agent responses",
    ],
    markdown=True,
    show_members_responses=True,
    enable_agentic_context=True,
    add_datetime_to_instructions=True,
    success_criteria="The team has provided a complete financial analysis with data, visualizations, risk assessment, and actionable investment recommendations supported by quantitative analysis and market research.",
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reasoning_finance_team.print_response("""Compare the tech sector giants (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT) performance:
        1. Get financial data for all three companies
        2. Analyze recent news affecting the tech sector
        3. Calculate comparative metrics and correlations
        4. Recommend portfolio allocation weights""",
        stream=True,
        show_full_reasoning=True,
        stream_intermediate_steps=True,
    )
```

## Level 5: Agentic Workflows with state and determinism

Workflows are deterministic, stateful, multi-agent programs built for production applications. We write the workflow in pure python, giving us extreme control over the execution flow.

Having built 100s of agentic systems, **no framework or step based approach will give you the flexibility and reliability of pure-python**. Want loops - use while/for, want conditionals - use if/else, want exceptional handling - use try/except.

<Check>
  Because the workflow logic is a python function, AI code editors can vibe code workflows for you.

  Add `https://docs.agno.com` as a document source and vibe away.
</Check>

Here's a simple workflow that caches previous outputs, you control every step: what gets cached, what gets streamed, what gets logged and what gets returned.

```python level_5_workflow.py
from typing import Iterator
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.utils.log import logger
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response
from agno.workflow import Workflow


class CacheWorkflow(Workflow):
    # Add agents or teams as attributes on the workflow
    agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"))

    # Write the logic in the `run()` method
    def run(self, message: str) -> Iterator[RunResponse]:
        logger.info(f"Checking cache for '{message}'")
        # Check if the output is already cached
        if self.session_state.get(message):
            logger.info(f"Cache hit for '{message}'")
            yield RunResponse(
                run_id=self.run_id, content=self.session_state.get(message)
            )
            return

        logger.info(f"Cache miss for '{message}'")
        # Run the agent and yield the response
        yield from self.agent.run(message, stream=True)

        # Cache the output after response is yielded
        self.session_state[message] = self.agent.run_response.content


if __name__ == "__main__":
    workflow = CacheWorkflow()
    # Run workflow (this is takes ~1s)
    response: Iterator[RunResponse] = workflow.run(message="Tell me a joke.")
    # Print the response
    pprint_run_response(response, markdown=True, show_time=True)
    # Run workflow again (this is immediate because of caching)
    response: Iterator[RunResponse] = workflow.run(message="Tell me a joke.")
    # Print the response
    pprint_run_response(response, markdown=True, show_time=True)
```

Run the workflow

```shell
python level_5_workflow.py
```

  ### Get Started with Agent UI

  ```bash
  # Create a new Agent UI project
  npx create-agent-ui@latest

  # Or clone and run manually
  git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-ui.git
  cd agent-ui && pnpm install && pnpm dev
  ```

  The UI will connect to `localhost:7777` by default, matching the Playground setup above. Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-ui) for more details.

# Monitoring & Debugging

> Monitor your Agents, Teams and Workflows in real-time.

# Monitoring

You can track your Agent in real-time on [app.agno.com](https://app.agno.com).

## Authenticate

Authenticate with [agno.com](https://app.agno.com) to start monitoring your sessions.
Check out [Authentication guide](how-to/authentication) for instructions on how to Authenticate with Agno.

## Enable Monitoring

Enable monitoring for a single agent or globally for all agents by setting `AGNO_MONITOR=true`.

### For a Specific Agent

```python
agent = Agent(markdown=True, monitoring=True)
```

### Globally for all Agents

```bash
export AGNO_MONITOR=true
```

## Monitor Your Agents

Run your agent and view the sessions on the [sessions page](https://app.agno.com/sessions).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a file with sample code">
    ```python monitoring.py
    from agno.agent import Agent

    agent = Agent(markdown=True, monitoring=True)
    agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story")
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run your Agent">
    ```shell
    python monitoring.py
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="View your sessions">

## Debug Logs

Want to see the system prompt, user messages and tool calls?

Agno includes a built-in debugger that will print debug logs in the terminal. Set `debug_mode=True` on any agent or set `AGNO_DEBUG=true` in your environment.

```python debug_logs.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),
    tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=True)],
    instructions="Use tables to display data. Don't include any other text.",
    markdown=True,
    debug_mode=True,
)
agent.print_response("What is the stock price of Apple?", stream=True)
```

Run the agent to view debug logs in the terminal:

```shell
python debug_logs.py
```

# What are Agents?

> Learn about Agno Agents and how they work.

**Agents** are AI programs that operate autonomously. Traditional software follows a pre-programmed sequence of steps. Agents dynamically determine their course of action using a machine learning **model**.

The core of an Agent is the **model**, **tools** and **instructions**:

* **Model:** controls the flow of execution. It decides whether to reason, act or respond.
* **Tools:** enable an Agent to take actions and interact with external systems.
* **Instructions:** are how we program the Agent, teaching it how to use tools and respond.

Agents also have **memory**, **knowledge**, **storage** and the ability to **reason**:

* **Reasoning:** enables Agents to "think" before responding and "analyze" the results of their actions (i.e. tool calls), this improves reliability and quality of responses.
* **Knowledge:** is domain-specific information that the Agent can **search at runtime** to make better decisions and provide accurate responses (RAG). Knowledge is stored in a vector database and this **search at runtime** pattern is known as Agentic RAG/Agentic Search.
* **Storage:** is used by Agents to save session history and state in a database. Model APIs are stateless and storage enables us to continue conversations from where they left off. This makes Agents stateful, enabling multi-turn, long-term conversations.
* **Memory:** gives Agents the ability to store and recall information from previous interactions, allowing them to learn user preferences and personalize their responses.

## Example: Research Agent

Let's build a research agent using Exa to showcase how to guide the Agent to produce the report in a specific format. In advanced cases, we should use [Structured Outputs](/agents/structured-output) instead.

<Note>
  The description and instructions are converted to the system message and the
  input is passed as the user message. Set `debug_mode=True` to view logs behind
  the scenes.
