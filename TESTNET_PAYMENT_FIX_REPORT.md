# Testnet Paid Transaction Fix Report

## Problem Summary
After adding MainNet support, testnet paid transactions were failing due to several critical issues:

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Empty MainNet Contract Addresses**
- **Issue**: MainNet contract addresses were set to empty strings in network configuration
- **Impact**: Caused validation failures and prevented proper contract interactions
- **Location**: `lib/network-config.ts` lines 81-83

### 2. **Incorrect CORAL Token Decimals**
- **Issue**: CORAL token payment amount used 6 decimals instead of 18 
- **Impact**: Payment calculations were wrong, causing transaction failures
- **Location**: `Contracts/SonicPaymentTestnet.sol` line 44
- **Fix**: Changed from `1 * 10**6` to `1 * 10**18`

### 3. **Missing Network Validation**
- **Issue**: No validation to check if contracts are properly deployed before allowing payments
- **Impact**: Users could attempt payments with invalid contract addresses
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive validation functions

### 4. **Insufficient Error Handling**
- **Issue**: Poor error messages when network configuration was invalid
- **Impact**: Users couldn't understand why payments were failing
- **Fix**: Added specific error messages for different failure scenarios

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Network Configuration Updates (`lib/network-config.ts`)

```typescript
// Added validation functions
export function validateNetworkConfig(config: NetworkConfig): boolean {
  const hasValidPaymentContract = config.contracts.payment && 
    config.contracts.payment !== '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
  
  return !!(
    config.chainId &&
    hasValidPaymentContract &&
    config.tokens.S_TOKEN &&
    config.tokens.USDC
  )
}

export function isMainnetContractsDeployed(): boolean {
  const mainnetConfig = SONIC_MAINNET_CONFIG
  return mainnetConfig.contracts.payment !== '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
}

export function getSafeNetworkConfig(chainId: number): NetworkConfig | null {
  const config = getNetworkConfig(chainId)
  if (!config) return null
  
  // For mainnet, check if contracts are deployed
  if (isMainnet(chainId) && !isMainnetContractsDeployed()) {
    console.warn('Mainnet contracts not yet deployed, some features may be unavailable')
  }
  
  return config
}
```

### 2. Smart Contract Fix (`Contracts/SonicPaymentTestnet.sol`)

```solidity
// FIXED: CORAL token decimals
uint256 public constant CORAL_COST = 1 * 10**18; // Now correctly uses 18 decimals
```

### 3. Payment Validation Updates (`components/ai-generation.tsx`)

Added validation checks to all payment methods:

```typescript
// Check if contracts are properly deployed and configured
if (!isValidConfig) {
  if (isMainnet(chainId || 0) && !isMainnetContractsDeployed()) {
    toast.error('Mainnet contracts are not yet deployed. Please use testnet for now.')
    return
  }
  toast.error('Invalid network configuration. Please try switching networks.')
  return
}
```

### 4. UI Improvements

- **Payment buttons** now disabled when contracts are invalid (`disabled={isGenerating || !prompt.trim() || !isValidConfig}`)
- **Status indicators** show when mainnet contracts are not deployed
- **Better error messages** explain exactly what's wrong

### 5. Deployment Script Fixes (`scripts/deploy-mainnet-contracts.js`)

Fixed the mainnet deployment script to:
- Use correct constructor parameters
- Remove invalid method calls
- Add FeeM registration
- Provide correct verification commands

## Testing Status

### âœ… Completed Fixes
- [x] Network configuration validation
- [x] Contract address resolution
- [x] CORAL token decimals fix
- [x] Payment button validation
- [x] Error messaging improvements
- [x] Deployment script corrections

### ðŸ”„ Next Steps Required
- [ ] Deploy contracts to Sonic Mainnet
- [ ] Test testnet payments thoroughly 
- [ ] Update environment variables with mainnet addresses
- [ ] Test mainnet functionality once contracts are deployed

## Environment Variables Needed

Once mainnet contracts are deployed, add these to your environment:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SONIC_PAYMENT_CONTRACT_MAINNET=0x... # From deployment
NEXT_PUBLIC_BANDIT_KIDZ_STAKING_CONTRACT_MAINNET=0x... # From deployment  
NEXT_PUBLIC_VOTING_CONTRACT_MAINNET=0x... # From deployment
```

## Recommended Testing Steps

1. **Test Testnet Payments**:
   - Switch to Sonic Testnet
   - Try SSStt token payments
   - Try CORAL token payments (now with correct decimals)
   - Try USDC payments
   - Try wS token payments

2. **Test Network Switching**:
   - Switch between testnet and mainnet
   - Verify appropriate warnings appear for mainnet
   - Verify payment buttons are disabled appropriately

3. **Deploy Mainnet Contracts**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:mainnet
   # or
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-mainnet-contracts.js --network sonic-mainnet
   ```

4. **Test Mainnet Integration**:
   - Update environment variables
   - Test mainnet payments
   - Verify payment distribution works correctly

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Better Error Handling**: Users now get clear messages about what's wrong
2. **Safer Validation**: Prevents invalid contract interactions
3. **Network Awareness**: System knows when contracts aren't deployed
4. **User Guidance**: Clear indicators guide users to working networks
5. **Fixed Calculations**: CORAL payments now use correct decimal places

The testnet should now work correctly for paid transactions, and the system is prepared for mainnet deployment.
