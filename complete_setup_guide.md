# ServiceFlow AI Complete Setup Guide

This guide will help you implement the complete ServiceFlow AI system with SrvcFlo, viral content generation, API key management, and blog posting functionality.

## üöÄ Quick Overview

You'll be setting up:
1. **SrvcFlo Agent** - Your AI lead for content strategy
2. **Viral Content Generation Team** - Research, writing, and social media specialists
3. **API Key System** - Waitlist management with exclusive access
4. **Blog Integration** - Automated posting to your website
5. **Enhanced Playground** - Complete agent ecosystem

## üìã Prerequisites

- Cloudflare Workers account (for your landing page)
- Email service (Gmail/SMTP) for welcome emails
- MongoDB or SQLite for data storage
- OpenAI API key
- Your existing ServiceFlow AI landing page

## üîß Step 1: Environment Setup

First, update your `.env` file:

```bash
# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

# Email Service
SERVICEFLOW_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
SERVICEFLOW_EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587

# Database (if using MongoDB)
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# ServiceFlow API
SERVICEFLOW_API_KEY=your_internal_api_key
SERVICEFLOW_BASE_URL=https://serviceflowai.app
```

## ü§ñ Step 2: Install the ServiceFlow AI Agents

1. **Create the agents file** (`serviceflow_agents.py`):
   - Copy the complete SrvcFlo agent code from the artifacts above
   - This includes SrvcFlo, the viral content team, and all specialists

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install agno openai googlesearch-python newspaper4k python-dotenv
```

3. **Test the agents**:
```bash
python serviceflow_agents.py
```

## üîë Step 3: Set Up API Key System

### Update Cloudflare Workers

1. **Add the waitlist database schema** to your Cloudflare D1:
```sql
CREATE TABLE waitlist_entries (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    business_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    owner_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    phone TEXT,
    business_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    current_challenges TEXT,
    interested_package TEXT,
    estimated_revenue TEXT,
    position INTEGER,
    api_key TEXT UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    email_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'active'
);

CREATE TABLE api_usage (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    api_key TEXT,
    endpoint TEXT,
    request_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    last_used TIMESTAMP,
    date_created TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

2. **Update your Workers script** with the API code from the artifacts

3. **Configure email service** in Workers (or use external service)

### Test the API

```bash
# Test waitlist signup
curl -X POST https://your-domain.workers.dev/api/waitlist \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "businessName": "Test Plumbing",
    "ownerName": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@testplumbing.com",
    "businessType": "plumber"
  }'
```

## üé® Step 4: Create the Portal Page

1. **Add the portal page** (`pages/portal.tsx`):
   - Copy the complete portal code from the artifacts
   - This gives waitlist users access to the content generator

2. **Add the blog components** to your Next.js app:
   - `components/BlogSection.tsx` - For the landing page
   - `pages/blog/[slug].tsx` - Individual blog posts
   - `pages/api/blog/` - Blog API endpoints

3. **Update your landing page** to include the blog section:
```tsx
// In your main page.tsx
import { BlogSection } from '@/components/BlogSection'

// Add this before your footer
<BlogSection />
```

## üåê Step 5: Integrate with Your Playground

Update your existing `playground.py`:

```python
# Add these imports
from serviceflow_agents import (
    srvcflo_agent,
    serviceflow_content_team,
    viral_researcher,
    viral_content_writer,
    social_media_specialist,
    blog_publisher
)

# Update your playground agents list
playground_app = Playground(
    agents=[
        srvcflo_agent,              # Add SrvcFlo as the lead
        serviceflow_content_team,   # Add the content team
        viral_researcher,           # Individual specialists
        viral_content_writer,
        social_media_specialist,
        blog_publisher,
        
        # Your existing agents
        lead_generation_agent,
        content_creation_agent,
        facebook_agent,
        google_agent,
        agno_assist,
        scraper_agent
    ],
    name="ServiceFlow AI Command Center",
    description="Complete AI ecosystem led by SrvcFlo for viral content and business automation"
)
```

## üìù Step 6: Set Up Blog Posting

1. **Add the blog posting tool** to SrvcFlo:
```python
# Add this to your serviceflow_agents.py
from serviceflow_blog_poster import create_blog_posting_tool

blog_posting_tool = create_blog_posting_tool(os.getenv('SERVICEFLOW_API_KEY'))

# Update SrvcFlo's tools
srvcflo_agent = Agent(
    name="SrvcFlo",
    tools=[blog_posting_tool, PythonTools(base_dir=tmp_dir)],
    # ... rest of configuration
)
```

2. **Test blog posting**:
```python
# Test with SrvcFlo
response = await srvcflo_agent.arun("""
Create and publish a viral blog post titled:
"The $50K Mistake Every Contractor Makes: Missing Emergency Calls"

Target contractors and home service providers. Include specific statistics, 
transformation stories, and a strong CTA for the ServiceFlow AI waitlist.
""")
```

## üéØ Step 7: Launch Your Content Strategy

### Viral Topic Ideas (Use these with SrvcFlo):

1. **"The $50K Mistake Every Contractor Makes: Missing Emergency Calls"**
2. **"Why Smart Plumbers Are Firing Their Answering Service"**
3. **"How One Hair Stylist Doubled Bookings While Working 20% Less"**
4. **"From 3 AM Panic Calls to Automated Profits: A Contractor's Journey"**
5. **"Manual Scheduling is Costing You $2,847 Monthly - Here's the Fix"**

### Content Generation Workflow:

1. **Strategy Phase**: Ask SrvcFlo to analyze a topic and provide strategic direction
2. **Research Phase**: The research specialist finds compelling data and statistics
3. **Creation Phase**: The content writer creates the viral blog post
4. **Social Phase**: The social specialist creates platform-specific content
5. **Publishing Phase**: The blog publisher posts everything to your website

### Example Command for SrvcFlo:
```
Generate a complete viral content package for contractors about emergency call automation. 
Include blog post, social media content for all platforms, and publish to the website. 
Focus on ROI, specific statistics, and driving waitlist signups.
```

## üîÑ Step 8: Automate the Workflow

### Daily Content Generation:
```python
# Create a scheduled script
async def daily_content_generation():
    topics = [
        "Emergency call automation for contractors",
        "Scheduling solutions for hair stylists", 
        "Lead capture for plumbing businesses",
        "Customer service automation for handymen"
    ]
    
    for topic in topics:
        await generate_viral_content_package(topic, "service businesses")
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)  # 1 hour between posts

# Run with cron or scheduled task
```

### Social Media Posting:
- Connect the social media content to Buffer, Hootsuite, or direct API posting
- Schedule posts across platforms at optimal times
- Track engagement and iterate on high-performing content

## üìä Step 9: Monitor and Optimize

### Track Key Metrics:
- **Waitlist signups** from blog content
- **Social media engagement** rates
- **Blog post views** and time on page
- **API usage** by waitlist members
- **Content viral potential** (shares, mentions)

### A/B Testing:
- Test different headlines and CTAs
- Compare industry-specific vs general content
- Monitor which platforms drive the most signups
- Optimize posting times and frequency

### Continuous Improvement:

### Debug Commands:
```python
# Test individual agents
await srvcflo_agent.arun("Generate a content strategy for plumbers")
await viral_researcher.arun("Find statistics about contractor emergency calls")
await viral_content_writer.arun("Write a blog post about scheduling automation")

# Test API endpoints
curl -X GET https://your-domain.workers.dev/api/waitlist
curl -X POST https://your-domain.workers.dev/api/portal/validate
```
