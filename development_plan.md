**Content Creation Agent:**
**Tools:** `OpenAIChat` (or similar) for content generation.
**Functionality:** Generate social media posts and other content.
**Chatbot Agent:**
**Tools:** `OpenAIChat` for NLP, custom tools for pricing calculation and scheduling.
**Functionality:** Provide estimates, generate images, and schedule appointments.
**Phone Agent:**
**Tools:** `Twilio` and `Dialogflow` for voice interaction.
**Functionality:** Handle incoming calls, answer FAQs, and schedule appointments.
***Teams:**
Create a team of agents to handle complex tasks, such as a "Customer Service Team" that includes the Chatbot and Phone agents.
***Memory & Storage:**
**Storage:** Use `SqliteStorage` or `MongoMemoryDb` to persist agent sessions and state.
**Memory:** Implement user-specific memory to personalize interactions.
**Knowledge:**
 Use `WebsiteKnowledgeBase` to provide agents with real-time information from the web.

 Design a clean, mobile-responsive UI using Figma prototypes as a guide.
 Implement the design using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
***Components:**
**Sign-Up Page:** A dynamic form that providers can customize.
**Main Page:** A dashboard displaying provider-specific services, the AI chatbot, and a scheduling calendar.
**Admin Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard for providers to manage their account, services, pricing, and AI agent configurations.
***State Management:** Use React's built-in state management (useState, useContext) or a library like Redux or Zustand if the application complexity grows.

## 5. Key Features Implementation

***Multi-Tenancy:** Implement a robust multi-tenant architecture to ensure data isolation and customization for each provider.
***Customizable AI:** Allow providers to configure the AI agents' behavior, including keywords for lead generation, chatbot scripts, and pricing formulas.
***Dynamic Business Info:** Enable providers to manage their business information, services, and branding through the admin dashboard.
***SaaS Billing:** Integrate Stripe for tiered SaaS subscriptions.

## 6. Testing & Deployment

**Testing:**

*Deployment:**
Deploy the Next.js frontend to a platform like Vercel or AWS.
Deploy the Node.js backend to a service like Heroku or AWS.
Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## 7. Development Roadmap

***Phase 1 (Months 1-2):** Project Setup, Backend & Database, Basic Agno Integration.
***Phase 2 (Months 3-4):** Core Frontend Development, Advanced Agno Integration.
***Phase 3 (Months 5-6):** SaaS Features (Multi-tenancy, Admin Dashboard), Testing.
