User Vision and RequirementsThe user's vision is to create a SaaS platform using the Agno framework, Agno UI, and playground for backend 
specialized agents, allowing higher package users to build agents and workflows specific to their business. Front-end user-facing apps are 
launched using Cloudflare Workers, with monetization through subscriptions and Sonic blockchain payments (e.g., image/video generation). 
The platform includes a landing page, agent launchpad for tool configs, and a voting system for generated content, with payments distributed 
to leaderboards, developer wallets, and NFT staking rewards. The attached files provide implementation details for backend agents and frontend 
configurations, which must be integrated into the prompt.Analysis of Attached FilesThe attached files include backend agent scripts and frontend 
configurations, analyzed as follows:Backend Agents:content_agent.py: An autonomous content creation and social media management tool for 
ServiceFlow AI, automating posts on X (Twitter), community engagement, and blog post generation. It uses ServiceFlowXTools, OpenAIChat, 
and DuckDuckGoTools, with SQLite for storage and a posting schedule (4-5 times daily, varying intervals). Key features include priority 
account management, rate limiting, and human-like communication.
facebook_agent.py: Defines a FacebookAgent for managing Facebook Pages, using the Facebook Graph API and MCP server. It supports 
content creation (posting, scheduling), management (comments, analytics), and communication, with token validation and error handling.
 It uses MongoDB for storage and OpenAI models for processing.
google_agent.py: Implements a GoogleAgent for Gmail and Google Calendar operations, using GmailTools and GoogleCalendarTools. 
It supports email sending, event creation, and query processing, with asynchronous operations, MongoDB storage, and timezone awareness.
main.py: A simple entry point printing "Hello from agents!", likely a placeholder for the application.

Frontend Configurations:components.json: Configuration for shadcn/ui, a React component library, using Tailwind CSS, React Server Components, and lucide icons. 
It defines aliases for components, utils, and hooks, indicating a structured frontend setup.
package.json: Lists dependencies for a Next.js project, including @ai-sdk/openai, @web3auth/modal, ethers, viem, wagmi, and thirdweb, confirming Web3 integrations. 
It also includes Cloudflare tools (wrangler, @cloudflare/workers-types), indicating deployment on Cloudflare Workers.
tsconfig.json: Standard TypeScript configuration for Next.js, with settings like allowJs, strict, and module resolution as bundler, ensuring type safety.
client_secret_645431798768-gverbsba88babmc6e8a8ctfp0fk3ievr.apps.googleusercontent.com.json: Contains Google API credentials (client ID, secret) for authentication, used by google_agent.py.
Temporary CORS files (temp_cors_serviceflow-ai-content.json, etc.): Define CORS settings, e.g., temp_cors_serviceflow-ai-content.json allows origins like https://srvcflo.com, methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and headers, ensuring secure cross-origin requests for AI content, NFT metadata, and user uploads.

Synthesis and Prompt DevelopmentGiven the user's vision and the attached files, I synthesized the information into an updated prompt for an AI tool, focusing on building the platform with minimal code. The prompt leverages existing frameworks (Agno, HuggingFace) and the provided AI agents to reduce development effort. Key considerations include:AI Agent Framework: Agno is selected as the primary framework, given its performance and support for multi-agent systems, with existing implementations (content_agent.py, facebook_agent.py, google_agent.py) providing functionality for content creation, social media management, and Google services.
Multi-Tenancy and Database: The database-per-tenant pattern with PostgreSQL is adopted for scalability and isolation, aligning with the user's requirements for tenant-specific customizations.
Frontend and Backend: Next.js with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for frontend, and Node.js/Express.js with Cloudflare Workers for backend, as evidenced by package.json and components.json.
Integrations: Integrate social media APIs (Facebook, X), AI generation with HuggingFace, payments with Stripe and Sonic blockchain (Web3Auth for crypto), and authentication methods, leveraging existing agents.
Monetization and User Flow: Implement free tiers, subscriptions, and per-use fees, with crypto payment bonuses (20%), and a voting system for generated content, as per the user's description.
Security and Compliance: Ensure GDPR compliance, leverage existing CORS configurations, and implement robust security measures.

Detailed PromptThe updated prompt, as provided in the direct answer, ensures the AI tool can build upon the existing architecture, leveraging the attached files to minimize development effort. It includes deliverables like architecture diagrams, database schemas, API endpoints, and sample code snippets, with a phased roadmap for development.Tables for ClarityBelow is a table summarizing the existing AI agents and their functionalities:Agent

We have C:\Users\PC\ServiceApp\agent-ui which is our backend agents chat UI.
In C:\Users\PC\ServiceApp\myserviceprovider-app we have the C:\Users\PC\ServiceApp\myserviceprovider-app\Agents C:\Users\PC\ServiceApp\myserviceprovider-app\Agents\playground.py are connected to the C:\Users\PC\ServiceApp\agent-ui this is what we will eventually want to develop into an app where they can Build their spacialized agents and workflows by command with the help of our documents agent , coding agent, and cloudflare agent. They should also be able to chat here locally with their specialized agents. They can keep these agents local or deployed by the agents to a runtime enviorment so that their agents code base is not added to ours. 

Our C:\Users\PC\ServiceApp\myserviceprovider-app\app and the C:\Users\PC\ServiceApp\myserviceprovider-app\src cloudflare workers associated with it is for our frontends usecase. We should also have a bridge via the C:\Users\PC\ServiceApp\myserviceprovider-app\Agents\http_srvcflo_agent.py. But only we should be able to access our backend agents. One of of cloudflare workers is meant to pass commands. In our users use case they would have one bridges to their agents. On our frontend cloudflare app we are starting out with monetizing the Image and Video generation workflow on the frontend. We should successfully test on the Sonic testnet before deploying contracts to the Main net. Our prices for the Image generation is as follows $1 USDC or $S token per image generation. $2 USDC - $S token for video generation. 
Payments are to be sent to the C:\Users\PC\ServiceApp\myserviceprovider-app\Contracts\SonicPaymentTestnet.sol where they are split 15% to wallet for leaderboard , 50% to dev app wallet for Ai cost and overhead, 25% to C:\Users\PC\ServiceApp\myserviceprovider-app\Contracts\BanditKidzStaking.sol where holders of an existing NFT collection i have will receive
rewards from revenue generated and FeeM generated from Transactions. FeeM should be split 50% dev, 30% NFT holders, Remaining Treasury. Once we have our Image and Generation monetized on Sonic and Our page to more reflect this along with the planned Agent Launchpad and Workflow Builder for both Individual users and Small service based businesses. We will begin focusing on the Development of our Middle agent UI. Shoudl be renamed something fitting for us. Where our agents will help ourr users build and configure their agents 
by that chat input and buttons they can select for the tools we have implemented on the backend so far would be nice.
