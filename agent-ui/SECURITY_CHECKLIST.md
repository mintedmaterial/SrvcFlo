# 🔒 Security Checklist - Before Pushing to GitHub

## ✅ Files Successfully Excluded by .gitignore

The following sensitive files are properly excluded:

### Environment Files
- [x] `.env` - Main environment file with API keys
- [x] `.env.local` - Local environment overrides  
- [x] `.env.production` - Production environment

### Credentials & Secrets
- [x] `client_secret_645431798768-gverbsba88babmc6e8a8ctfp0fk3ievr.apps.googleusercontent.com.json`
- [x] `token.json`
- [x] `credentials/` directory
- [x] `*token*.json` files
- [x] `*.pem` files
- [x] `*.key` files

### Additional Security Exclusions
- [x] `rootkey.csv`
- [x] `.dev.vars`
- [x] `wrangler.toml`
- [x] `tmp/` and `temp/` directories

## 🔍 Security Verification Steps

1. **Check Git Status**: Run `git status` and verify NO sensitive files appear
2. **Review .gitignore**: Confirm all patterns are correct
3. **Test with Git Add**: Run `git add .` and check what gets staged

## 🚀 Safe-to-Commit Files

These files are safe and should be included:
- [x] Source code (`src/`, `components/`, etc.)
- [x] Configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.)
- [x] Documentation (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, etc.)
- [x] `.env.example` - Template file with no real secrets
- [x] `.gitignore` - Exclusion rules
- [x] Public assets and components

## ⚠️ Before Each Commit

1. **Double-check git status**: `git status`
2. **Review staged files**: `git diff --cached`
3. **Verify no secrets**: Search for API keys, passwords, private keys
4. **Test build**: Ensure `npm run build` works
5. **Validate environment**: Test with `.env.example`

## 🔄 If Secrets Were Accidentally Committed

If you accidentally commit secrets:

1. **Don't panic** - Remove them immediately
2. **Force push** to overwrite history (if safe)
3. **Rotate all exposed credentials** immediately
4. **Add better gitignore rules**

## 📋 Post-Push Checklist

After pushing to GitHub:
- [ ] Verify repository is private (if needed)
- [ ] Check GitHub security tab for alerts
- [ ] Set up environment variables in deployment platform
- [ ] Test deployment with example environment
- [ ] Monitor for any security issues

**🔒 Remember: It's always better to be overly cautious with secrets!**
